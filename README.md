# qtl_neurnet
A simple neural network for phenotype prediction in a recombinant inbred population. The neural network algorithm is implemented from scratch in java and C++ without the use of external packages. The example shown is a soybean RIL population genotyped by SNP chip and segregating for nematode disease susceptibility.
